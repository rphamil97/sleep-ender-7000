# sleep-ender-7000
I'm tired (pun intended) of waking up, turning off an alarm, and accidentally falling back asleep so I'm making this alarm clock that will force you to do a little game before it actually turns off

## Main Idea
The Sleep Ender 7000 will be an alarm clock that will be powered via USB. When the alarm goes off, you will need to play a short game using controls on the clock. Hopefully the game will engage you enough such that you are awake enough that you stay up and start your day.

## Ideas
I'm just writing down what comes to mind.
- the game could be the radar tuner thing from Gears 5
  - I have the rotary encoders and nav sticks necessary to make it work
- I'll need to build a small amplifier circuit. I'd just use the one from the (Arduino Audio tutorial) [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SimpleAudioPlayer]
